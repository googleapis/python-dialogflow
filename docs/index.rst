You can use the Dialogflow API to detect the intent from texts:

.. literalinclude:: ../samples/detect_intent_texts.py
    :start-after: # [START dialogflow_detect_intent_text]
    :end-before: # [END dialogflow_detect_intent_text]

Detecting Intent (Audio)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the Dialogflow API to detect the intent of a speaker given an
audio file:

.. literalinclude:: ../samples/detect_intent_audio.py
    :start-after: # [START dialogflow_detect_intent_audio]
    :end-before: # [END dialogflow_detect_intent_audio]

Detecting Intent (Streaming Audio)
